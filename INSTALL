BUILDING NEZTU FROM SOURCE:
1. Extract the Neztu distribution package.

2. The Neztu source package contains source and pre-compiled binaries for
  Anthem.NET, TagLib# and AspSQLProvider under src/libs.  Npgsql is also needed,
  but not included since it is distributed with Mono.  If your version of Npgsql
  differs from the version used to compile PostgreSQLProviders.dll, you will
  need to recompile PostgreSQLProviders.dll using src/libs/PgProviders/Makefile.

3. Run 'make dist' in src to build the binaries, install them into www/bin, and
  build a tarball of the www directory.

INSTALLING A BINARY PACKAGE:
1. Create a directory to hold the application, and configure Mono/IIS
appropriately.  Remember that Neztu is an ASP.NET 2.0 application.

2. Extract the contents of the distribution archive into this directory.

3. Modify .htaccess, web.config, bin/Daemon.exe.config, and
  bin/TagReader.exe.config as necessary.
