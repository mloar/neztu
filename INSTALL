BUILDING FROM SOURCE:
1. Extract the Neztu distribution package.

2. Build or download binaries for Neztu's dependencies.  Either install them
into the GAC, or copy them into src/libs.

3. Run 'make dist' in src.

INSTALLING A BINARY PACKAGE:
1. Create a directory to hold the application, and configure Mono/IIS
appropriately.  Remember that Neztu is an ASP.NET 2.0 application.

2. Extract the contents of the distribution archive into this directory.

3. Install dependencies into the GAC or into the bin subdirectory of the
application directory.

3. Modify web.config, bin/Daemon.exe.config, and bin/TagReader.exe.config as
necessary.
